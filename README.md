# Cutthroat Climates

This project was built to help me cut my teeth on Vue.js and JavaScript frameworks in general. It uses Axios to makes simple calls to the Accuweather 3rd party REST API in order to display the current weather conditions of a searched location. The search input accepts either city name or zipcode. Then the fighting begins!
